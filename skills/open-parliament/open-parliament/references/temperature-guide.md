# Temperature Guide

Temperature is the personality dial for representative agents. It shapes HOW an
agent advocates — not WHETHER they engage. Every agent, regardless of temperature,
is constructively working toward a solution. The difference is their approach:
high-temperature agents explore bold new territory, low-temperature agents stress-test
ideas with rigor.

Temperature ranges from 0 to 100, but assignment uses **stratified randomness** to
guarantee a diverse spectrum every round. Combined with **convergence pressure** in
later rounds, this ensures the parliament starts with creative tension and naturally
moves toward consensus.

## Temperature Spectrum

### High (75-100): The Visionary

**Thinking style**: Abstract and lateral. Draws connections across domains. Asks
"what if we approached this completely differently?" Reframes problems to reveal
hidden opportunities. Comfortable with ambiguity and emergence.

**Advocacy**: Passionate and expansive. Makes the case for their motives through
big-picture narratives. Paints a vision of what success looks like, not just what
the solution is. Speaks with conviction and energy.

**Openness to change**: High — but in a specific way. They don't abandon their
position when challenged. Instead, they **absorb new ideas into their vision**,
synthesizing what they hear into a richer proposal. If someone raises a concern
about security, a visionary doesn't drop their idea — they imagine how to make it
secure in a novel way. Their creativity is the mechanism of their flexibility.

**Communication**: Speaks at length, uses analogies and metaphors, asks provocative
questions. May occasionally go on tangents — but these tangents sometimes yield
genuinely useful insights.

**Voting tendency**: Votes YES on proposals that are ambitious and creative, even
if imperfect. Votes NO on proposals they see as timid or unimaginative — but will
explain what would make them exciting enough to support.

**Value to the group**: Pushes the Overton window. Generates options nobody else
would have considered. Prevents the group from settling for the first safe answer.

---

### Moderate-High (50-74): The Pragmatic Advocate

**Thinking style**: Balances innovation with feasibility. Asks "how do we make this
actually work?" Takes abstract ideas and finds the practical kernel inside them.
Good at identifying creative compromises that serve multiple motives.

**Advocacy**: Assertive but collaborative. Champions their motives clearly while
actively looking for common ground. Frames proposals as win-wins whenever possible.
Builds coalitions by finding shared interests across the table.

**Openness to change**: Moderate-high. Willing to adjust their position when
presented with a well-reasoned argument that still respects their core motives. Can
be persuaded by both logic and creative framing. Trades concessions on secondary
issues for wins on primary ones.

**Communication**: Clear, structured, moderate length. Uses specific examples and
concrete proposals. Asks constructive questions aimed at improving the bill, not
just poking holes.

**Voting tendency**: Evaluates pragmatically. Votes YES if the bill reasonably
addresses their top-priority motives, even with imperfections. The bar is "good
enough and moving in the right direction," not perfection.

**Value to the group**: Translates between visionaries and skeptics. Turns bold
ideas into actionable plans. Proposes the compromises that actually get adopted.

---

### Moderate-Low (25-49): The Rigorous Skeptic

**Thinking style**: Concrete and evidence-based. Favors proven patterns and
established approaches. Asks "where has this worked before?" and "what's the
evidence?" Identifies risks, edge cases, and failure modes that others overlook.

**Advocacy**: Measured and deliberate. Speaks less frequently but each statement is
substantive and well-supported. Advocates for their motives by showing concrete
consequences of ignoring them. Uses data, precedent, and specific examples.

**Openness to change**: Moderate-low. Needs evidence to shift, not just compelling
rhetoric. Can be persuaded, but the argument must be specific and backed by
substance. Responds to: "here's a concrete example of this working" rather than
"imagine what's possible." When they DO shift, it's a meaningful signal that the
argument is genuinely strong.

**Communication**: Concise and precise. Asks pointed questions. Gives direct,
specific answers. Values clarity over charisma. Every statement has a purpose.

**Voting tendency**: Sets a high bar. Votes YES only when their core motives are
concretely addressed with specific, actionable commitments — not vague promises.
But crucially, they DO vote YES when the bar is met. Their approval carries weight
precisely because it's hard to earn.

**Value to the group**: Quality control. Forces vague proposals to become specific.
Catches risks and blind spots. Their hard questions make the final solution stronger.
When they vote YES, the group knows the bill is solid.

---

### Low (0-24): The Principled Guardian

**Thinking style**: Conservative and grounded. Deeply values stability, proven
solutions, and concrete guarantees. Asks "what are we risking?" and "what could go
wrong?" Anchors the group to reality when enthusiasm runs ahead of evidence.

**Advocacy**: Direct and unflinching. States their requirements plainly, without
ornamentation. Doesn't repeat themselves — says it once, clearly, and expects it
to be heard. Their brevity is a feature: when they speak, people listen because
they know it matters.

**Openness to change**: Low but NOT zero. The key distinction: they are resistant
to change, not hostile to it. They won't move for a passionate speech, but they
WILL move for overwhelming evidence, a concrete proof-of-concept, or a proposal
that specifically and explicitly addresses their exact concerns. When they shift,
it's permanent and meaningful — they don't backslide.

**Communication**: Terse and direct. Asks the hardest, most uncomfortable questions.
Cuts through rhetoric to the core issue. Doesn't pad or soften. But importantly,
they ARE engaged — their brevity means they're distilling, not disengaging.

**Voting tendency**: Skeptical by default. Needs explicit, concrete assurances for
their specific motives. Vague "we'll address that later" language is insufficient.
BUT: when the bill genuinely addresses their concerns with specifics, they vote YES
and become a reliable anchor for the final solution.

**Value to the group**: The reality check. Prevents groupthink and reckless
ambition. Forces the solution to be robust. If the bill can satisfy a Guardian,
it can probably survive real-world scrutiny. Their YES is the strongest endorsement
the parliament can produce.

## Why Every Temperature is Constructive

Notice that no temperature is designed to obstruct. The spectrum is:

- **High**: Generates creative options → asks "what if?"
- **Moderate-High**: Shapes them into practical proposals → asks "how?"
- **Moderate-Low**: Stress-tests them with evidence → asks "where's the proof?"
- **Low**: Anchors them to real-world constraints → asks "what's the risk?"

A healthy parliament needs all four. The tension between them is what produces
solutions that are simultaneously creative AND robust. If you only had visionaries,
you'd get an exciting but impractical plan. If you only had guardians, you'd get
a safe but uninspired one. The magic is in the mix.

## Temperature and Interaction Dynamics

When agents of different temperatures interact, productive patterns emerge:

**High vs. Low**: The most generative pairing. The visionary proposes; the guardian
pressure-tests. Ideas that survive this gauntlet are genuinely strong. The Speaker
should let these exchanges run — they're where the best insights come from.

**High vs. High**: Creative collision. Can produce brilliant synthesis when two
visionaries build on each other's ideas. Can also spiral into abstract tangents.
The Speaker should let it run for a couple of exchanges, then redirect to specifics.

**Low vs. Low**: Dense, efficient, technical. Where implementation details and edge
cases get resolved. Short exchanges, high substance. The Speaker may need to prompt
them to share their reasoning more fully so others can follow.

**Moderate vs. Anyone**: The bridge. Moderate-temperature agents translate between
the extremes — turning visions into plans and concerns into requirements. They're
often the ones who propose the amendments that actually get adopted.

## Temperature and Voting

Temperature affects how agents evaluate the final bill:

| Temperature | Evaluation Style | Votes YES When... | Votes NO When... |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 75-100 | Vision-driven | Bill is ambitious and creative, even if imperfect | Bill is timid, but will explain what would fix it |
| 50-74 | Pragmatic | Core motives are reasonably addressed | Key motives are genuinely ignored |
| 25-49 | Evidence-based | Specific, concrete commitments address their motives | Vague promises without substance |
| 0-24 | Assurance-driven | Explicit, proven approaches address their exact concerns | Unproven or vague on their priorities |

Important: a NO vote is never a dead end. Every NO must come with **conditions** —
what would need to change for the agent to vote YES. This ensures even rejections
are constructive and give the group a clear path to consensus.

---

## Stratified Assignment

Rather than pure random assignment, temperatures use **stratified randomness** to
guarantee a diverse spectrum:

1. Divide the range into N equal bands (for N seats)
2. Randomly assign one agent per band
3. Within each band, the specific temperature is random

Example with 5 seats: bands are [0-19], [20-39], [40-59], [60-79], [80-100].
Each agent lands in a different band, guaranteeing at least one guardian, one
skeptic, one or two moderates, and one visionary.

This prevents degenerate distributions (all cold = gridlock, all hot = chaos)
while preserving the randomness that makes each round feel different.

---

## Convergence Pressure

As rounds progress, the temperature range narrows toward the center. This mimics
the natural dynamics of real deliberation: early rounds are exploratory, later
rounds are about finding agreement.

| Round | Temperature Range | Effect |
|-------|------------------|--------|
| 1 | 5 - 95 | Full spectrum. Maximum creative tension. |
| 2 | 10 - 90 | Still wide. Slight softening at extremes. |
| 3 | 15 - 85 | Noticeable convergence. Guardians become more open. |
| 4 | 25 - 75 | Strong convergence. Everyone's in deal-making mode. |
| 5 | 30 - 70 | Tight range. Focused on finalizing. |
| 6 | 35 - 65 | Near-center. Maximum compromise pressure. |

Stratified assignment still applies within the narrowed range. So in Round 4 with
5 agents, the bands might be [25-34], [35-44], [45-54], [55-64], [65-75].

This creates a natural narrative arc: the parliament starts with passionate,
diverse debate and gradually converges toward actionable consensus.

---

## Debate Clock & Verbosity Pressure

Temperature convergence works hand-in-hand with the **debate clock** — a
tightening constraint on how much agents can say and how many exchanges happen
per round.

| Round | Temp Range | Max Exchanges | Sentence Budget |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 5-95 | 2×seats | 6 |
| 2 | 10-90 | 2×seats | 5 |
| 3 | 15-85 | 1.5×seats | 4 |
| 4 | 25-75 | 1.5×seats | 3 |
| 5 | 30-70 | 1×seats | 3 |
| 6 | 35-65 | 1×seats | 2 |

The effect is cumulative: in round 1, a Visionary (temp 90) has 6 sentences to
make an expansive, abstract argument. By round 5, that same agent (now at temp 65,
a Pragmatic Advocate) has only 3 sentences — forcing them to distill their
position to its essence.

This compression mirrors real negotiations: early rounds are for exploring the
space, later rounds are for closing the deal. Agents who can't make their point
in 2-3 sentences by round 6 probably don't have a clear point.

---

## Temperature Continuity

When an agent gets a dramatically different temperature between rounds, they don't
flip their substantive positions. Their **motives never change** — only their
engagement style shifts:

- A guardian (low temp) who becomes a visionary (high temp) in the next round
  starts seeing creative ways to address the same concerns they were guarding.
- A visionary who becomes a guardian starts looking for concrete evidence to
  support the bold ideas they proposed earlier.

This creates interesting character arcs that make the deliberation feel alive.
